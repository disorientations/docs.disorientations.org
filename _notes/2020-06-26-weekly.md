### Followups
- Update on our communications with student groups so far. What do we know about their timelines? Are there publishing milestones we should be aware of?
- Different meeting time?

## Notes
- Hard to approach the representation problem through outreach... A continued conversation.
- If we want to include more people, offer something so it's not just reaching out for the sake of that. Think more of what we offer.
- To write and make more explicit: where we're at and where we want to be. "We are an open group... seeking to be representative of the issues covered in Disos... We are lokoing for student activists..." 
- "Know your limits." (U Chicago) -> can we make our limits and aspirations more explicit?
- If we get to a point where consensus becomes an issue, consider starting to institute a formal process with transparent voting. Look here for inspiration: https://wiki.php.net/rfc
- When in doubt, opt for transparency.
- Consider reaching out to universities and other organizations with a predominant BIPOC membership to bolster diversity within our group.

## Decisions
- Weekly Meetings Tuesday 4:30pm PT / 7:30pm ET, next meeting July 7.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Matthew - Upcoming conference, Sunshine PHP, to learn how they work on diversity and share back. https://sunshinephp.com/ 
- [ ] Individually write a few sentences or paragraph or two and share it next week on where we're at and where we wanna go re: race, representation, etc.
- [ ] Add links to working files to website for transparency / easy access.
