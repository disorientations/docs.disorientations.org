# 2020-05-29 Casey/Sb

Call for putting into context
with people overthinking it for decades

anti-alumni
dis-alumni

motivations for joining?
student-member-owner-worker

establishing cooperative network

alternative structure for looking at institutions
makes me want to get involved

how concerns change over time

a way to see moments not as islands

institutions control arrivals and departures

blank slate every 4 years

visibility -- what it meant
momentum
fruitful in a time

systematically corall
stifling of imagination

existinguishing narrative

whackamole

history of it and space to create whatever they are

just trying to pass
make the most of time/money
campuses prey on naivet√©

limits of imagination
at times in my life

knowing of a way of existing in other places

archiving as resistance
knowable, discoverable, understandable

I can't pass the torch
fuck that place!
shares that burden

untimely collaboration
