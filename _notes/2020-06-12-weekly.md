## Notes



## Decisions
- Adopted Geek Feminism Wiki Code of Conduct
- Delay contributors/volunteer crediting until there's further discussion with groups being archived, so they can have ownership over that identity

## Next Steps
- [x] Casey add Code of Conduct to Zulip and Website
- [x] Casey onboard Emma (including Omeka)
- [ ] Matt scope feature on extracting tags from metadata
- [ ] Emma check if Slack for covid intercollegiate is active
- [ ] Everyone take a look at the questions for student activist publishers and add comments/edits
