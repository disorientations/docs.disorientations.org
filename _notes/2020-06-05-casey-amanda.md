How did you get into this

Ala Vera Cruz

Zine Librarian Code of Ethics unconference, Montreal

physical archive

totally PDFs

Omeka
Drupal
	used core modules
		can do a lot without being a programmer
		has become such a big project with so many modules, what's the best way to do something

original site Drupal 5 in 2008, library studies degree project, with a PHP programmer.

Got a grant to redo the project.

each major version is so different

zine union, collectiveaccess

a tool to manage that

spawns more work

anchor archive
library part is important
we also do a lot of workshops and programming
a space for people who are creating their work, encouraging people to create work when you know it goes into a library and others will have access to it
zine fair
part of zines is to inspire people to make more zines, to see weird, interesting, person thing people are sharing

like that you wanna connect
seems like a static archive, connecting to groups and provide 

narrow collection, so overwhelming to curate or manage, but you want it to be inclusive and show connections

linked through other languages

every fall an alternative "radfrosh" don't know how common it is

broad collection policy, take anything that is a zine. sometimes there's some debate around if it's a pamphlet, but lots of argument. no hate literature. lots of donations. buy zines at zine fairs or order zines but a very small budget.

box categories because zines are in boxes
each zine can only be in one box because physical

subject terms apply additional terms
multiple points of access

advantage of using subject terms of searching, we can't have search because of physical

even with full text searching different zinemakers use different terminology
hear what you're saying that people should be able to describe themselves and there are ethical considerations of labelling identities

but for readers there's an advantage of being able to find all the queer zines

that's why we created our own subject headings and choosing care into choosing them

now our thesaurus is out of date

goal of the group is to have multiple people creating the thesaurus, keepng it up to date

where do you start?

cataloging is done by volunteers, definitely some things cataloged better than others. 

when people enter a new zine in our catalog, they choose their own terms in the drupal thesaurus, but we'd look at those terms and add them back

lots of catch up work

the way I started was just cataloging. as I was cataloging I would add terms. I had a bunch of time because I did it as a school project, then got a grant and hired somebody to work on it over the summer.

some backwards editing that happens. my approach was to use language that's current and empowering, choose terms that zine makers use and that readers will search for. catalog a bunch more and realize there's another word that's better.

proper nouns. college presidents. our policy is to only add proper nouns if they are appearing in many zines. we have a lot of music zines with band names. put them in the summary field, so they're retrievable by search. we do add some to the thesaurus, people or institutions that get written about a lot. is it a term that somebody would search for. 

thesaurus, used an opensource application called THEW32 and it worked really well. simple interface, broader and narrower terms. developed by some guy in 2005. he did an update in 2013 but not maintained and not viable anymore. that's still the form that has the relationships. new terms are in drupal and not necessarily in the other.

i'll share our documents. mainly what i'm finding is some ontology management tools, seems to be where most of the development. i find that whole thing kind of confusing and overly complex. most open source options are in that vein. there are a couple that still use RDF tags. there's not one that does backend and will publish on a website. no institution has offered to support us. don't want it to be technically onerous. drupal has a taxonomy module. it doesn't do everything we want to do but I still have a relationship with developers I worked with, anarchist drupal coop in spain.

strucutre

where did you get grants?

our project is local, everybody who's involved lives in halifax and we meet in person and have been organizing as a group for a long time. we're able to develop a relationship in a physical space. 

don't know if i've been in any zine related collaborative projects with the scale or formality that you're talking about. haven't been involved in many outside of physical location. 

people like jenna would have some other ideas. 

queer zine archive project - milo, milauwakee, physical space, collective of people who live there, digitize queer zines (https://www.qzap.org)

student orgs, most involved. i don't know what it's like. most universities have a public interest research group, funding from student fees, activist group within the university. berg. lots of turnover but it's a stable group so they might be more able to commit to being involved in a more present - PIRG.
