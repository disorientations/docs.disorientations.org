4. You will be prompted about line breaks, you can just select `Switch Now`

5. In the settings, under "Select repo" you will only have one option. Select `disorientations/docs.disorientations.org`. "Select branch" will autofill with `master` and you can leave this as is.

6. Under "Select file" you can choose which folder and what filename you want to sync this document to. If it's a "how to"-type document, use the `_docs` folder. If it's meeting notes, use the `_notes` folder.

7. After selecting the folder, you can type in your desired filename and click `Create a new file`. It will automatically add the `.md` extension for you. Check out the other filenames in the folder and try to match the convention you see there.

8. Lastly, you need to add a "version name". This is kind of like a status message about what you are changing, so I often just write "Push to Github" to indicate that I'm syncing a new note.

9. Submit the form, and you should see a confirmation screen appear.

10. Once you've configured a file's sync configuration, you'll see a streamlined interface in the `Versions and Github Sync` modal. You can now push updates to the file just by clicking Sync and adding a brief note about what has changed in the version name.

11. Check docs.disorientations.org -- your note should be published there within a minute or two!
